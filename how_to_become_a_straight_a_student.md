1. Study Basics
   1. Manage your time in five minutes a day 
      1. Jot down to-dos and deadlines on a list whenever they arrive
      2. Transfer these to-dos and deadlines to your calendar every morning
      3. Plan your day each morning by labelling your to-dos with realistic time-frames and moving what you don't have time for to different dates.
   2. Declare war on procrastination
      1. Keep a work progress log, and record every day what you set out to accomplish and whether you accomplished it or not.
      2. When working, eat healthy snacks to maximise your energy.
      3. Transform horrible tasks into a big event to help you gather the energy to start.
      4. Build work routines to make steady progress on your obligations without expending too much of your limited motivational resources.
      5. Choose your hard days in advance to minimise their impact.
   3. Choose when, where and how long
      1. Try to fit as much work as possible into the morning and afternoon, between classes and obligations
      2. Study in isolated locations
      3. Take a break every hour
2. Quizzes and exams
   1. Take smart notes
      1. Always take the best notes possible in class
      2. For nontechnical courses, capture the big ideas by taking notes in the question/evidence/conclusion format.
         1. If it’s a discussion class, note down interesting observations you heard or thought about.
         2. Share those that you had.
      3. For technical courses, **record as many sample problems as possible**. 
         1. Don’t read ahead, but bring your notes to class and listen attentively. Anything you don’t understand, use the readings to fill in the blanks.
            1. First priority: Record the problem statement and answer.
            2. Second priority: Question the confusing
            3. Third priority: Copy the steps to solving the problem
            4. Fourth priority: Annotate the steps - technical explanations
   2. Demote your assignments
      1. Work constantly and plan your schedule on Sunday
      2. For non-technical courses, prioritise readings that **make arguments**, over those that **describe an event or person**, over those that **provide only context**.
      3. When reading, use the question-evidence-conclusion framework. 
         1. Find the question, then the conclusion, then the evidence.
         2. Copy the question and conclusion, as well as the evidence in point form with references to the original material, into a study guide. 
         3. Read for arguments, not facts.
      4. Don’t work alone on problem sets.
         1. Find people who can help quickly
         2. Think of solutions on the go
         3. Always write solutions properly to avoid rework
   3. Marshal your resources
      1. Studying should feel effortless
         1. You should chip away at each module every day
      2. You should only be studying your own notes before a test
      3. Define the challenge
         1. Which lecture notes/ tutorials are tested?
         2. How many of each type of question is tested?
         3. Are cheat sheets allowed?
      4. Build a study guide for non-technical material
         1. Print out corresponding notes for each lecture and reading assignment 
         2. Gather notes on each separate lecture and assignment topic by topic
         3. You should have a study guide containing one pile for each general topic
      5. Construct a mega-problem set for technical material
         1. Start a pile for each topic
         2. Put technical explanation questions inside
         3. Put sample problems from lecture notes inside
         4. Put tutorial questions inside
         5. Put Past Year Papers inside
      6. Use flashcards for rote learning
      7. Do organisation and review on different days
   4. Conquer the material
      1. Always quiz-and-recall
         1. Studying should be to pass your own diagnostic questions
            1. For nontechnical courses, the QEC framework provides all your questions
            2. Answer your questions aloud
            3. Take one day to make your quizzes, a few hours to review
            4. For technical courses, do your mega problem set - start from technical explanations, then the lecture problems
            5. Take test papers under timed conditions
   5. Invest in academic disaster insurance
      1. Put question marks where you are unclear, and clarify them right after the lecture
   6. Provide A+ Answers
      1. Review the whole exam first, and answer questions later
      2. Build a time budget and leave out ten minutes for a buffer
      3. Proceed from easy to hard
      4. Outline essays
      5. Check your work
3. Essays and Papers
   1. Target a titillating topic
      1. Find interesting connections between broad themes or individuals in your discussions/readings
   2. Conduct a thesis hunting expedition
      1. For critical analysis, review the reading notes and lecture notes related to the essay prompt for your thesis
      2. For research papers, start general - look at general history books and target the bibliographies.  From the sources used, find the most promising ones and read those
      3. Find things to compare or unexamined influences on a particular subject. Find strong evidence for this connection you want to examine. Find an interesting topic and targeted thesis
   3. Seek a second opinion
      1. Check with the professor whether your topic and thesis are ok
         1. Is your idea appropriate
         2. Does it cover too much
         3. Is it too simple
      2. For research papers, list your sources to the professor and collect more sources
   4. Research like a machine
      1. Find sources
         1. Those that you find in step 2 are general like biographies or textbooks
         2. You need specific sources like journal articles or books about a specific event
         3. Follow Step 2 and start from general, then go specific by looking at the bibliographies
         4. If you have access to a library catalogue, follow the classification and search for other books in that category
         5. For topics that are more recent, find papers instead of books. If the search is not turning up results:
            1. Break up your query into general chunks - targeting subsets of aspects of your topic
            2. Use journal databases like JSTOR to find an academic concentration, and then search from general to narrow
            3. When in doubt, google for sources
            4. ask a librarian
            5. make personal copies of all sources - write the bibliographical info
               1. Also photocopy the bibliography of the source so that you can cite their citations
            6. Annotate the material
               1. Skim for gems and write down the page number and what this point is in your annotations which you will staple to your photocopy of the source
            7. Decide if you are done
               1. List down all topics that support your thesis
               2. List topics that *may* help the thesis
               3. If you have at least 2 sources for all the topics from 1 and at least 1 for most of the topics in 2, stop
   5. Craft a powerful story
      1. Formulate your argument 
         1. have a vision of what the overall structure of the paper should be - some focal point
         2. Your paper must extend previous discussion
         3. Introduce a thesis and spell out how it relates to existing work on similar issues
         4. Support the thesis with careful reasoning and references to existing arguments, evidence and primary sources.
         5. Introduce some final prognostications about extending the argument and its potential impact on the field as a whole
         6. There is no set order for presenting the above 4 points
         7. Find a good paper like the NYT to read and clear your mind to get in the right mind for writing
         8. Grab source material from the previous stack and let the facts play around in your mind.
         9. Soak up the material until you fully internalise it.
      2. Construct an outline
         1. For each self contained point, put them in a skeleton. Reordering comes next
         2. Rearrange those self-contained points until they flow. If you realise you should insert a topic here that you did not research, go back to step 1 and find those topics
      3. Filling in the details of your topic outline
         1. Once the topic skeleton is done and sources for all unsupported topics are found, it’s time to fill in the supporting details.
            1. Below each header in your topic skeleton, reference the evidence. Sharing information between topics at this point is fine. Use only your photocopy notes and their accompanying annotations.
   6. Consult your expert panel
      1. Bring your topic skeleton to your professor
   7. Write without the agony
      1. Edit after you finish writing and don’t research after you start writing
      2. Write in a quiet place
      3. Follow your outline and move slowly
   8. Fix, don’t fixate
      1. Argument adjustment pass - focus on structural issues. Reorder points or delete needless expositions
      2. Out loud pass - read your paper aloud - mark awkward constructions or grammatical mistakes on the printout of your paper
      3. Sanity pass - read your paper in its final form once for any stray mistakes.
