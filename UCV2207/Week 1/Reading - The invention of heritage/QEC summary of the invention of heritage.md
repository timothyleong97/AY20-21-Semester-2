# Title : The invention of heritage 

Question: Why are governments putting heritage on their official agendas?

Evidence:

___

How is heritage deployed for nation-building?

Thanksgiving - turkey is an American bird , cranberries are an American fruit

After the civil war, Thanksgiving was a time of remembrance after the Civil War

Thanksgiving is in Autumn, during harvest time, but oranges represent fall - abit inconsistent but that’s the beauty of heritage

Thanksgiving is a cultural must 

	- anybody can do it, even immigrants so it’s inclusive

We talk about Thanksgiving in the context of pilgrims - the puritans leaving england because of religious persecution is the reason why America needed to exist

- thanksgiving indirectly gives legitimacy to the republic
- Parents take their kids out for parades - just like National Day Parade in Singapore
- Thanksgiving has an infantile component - children participate in activities 
  - high power as an integrative mechanism - gets people early in their youth
- Thanksgiving is for people to go back home once a year - and there are 3 3hr football games which is a great amnesiac for people 
- Even the president has stuff to do

- So thanksgiving is invented out of pieces of history that Americans remember and appreciate, and no matter what kind of American you are, you can participate.

The problem with retrospin is that it;‘s not inclusive - not many people were musicians in Singapore or involved in music consumption in some way
