## Question: What is ‘tradition’ according to Hobsbawm. How do you use this term? How is it different from ‘custom’, ‘culture’, ‘history’, ‘life style’ and other such words used to describe how people live?

Practices of a ritualistic nature, those governed by accepted rules, and those which seek to inculcate certain values

Tradition must have meaning - so if it’s lost your life loses some meaning - practices that you discontinue that have no meaning are not tradition

Traditions have to seem invariant

Traditions are different from procedures - they are more arbitrary and less routine

Tradition and routine can inform each other

I use this term to mean the transmission of customs or beliefs from generation to generation, or the fact of being passed on in this way.

Customs are widely accepted ways of behaving or doing something

## Question: How would you define the term ‘heritage’? What relationship would it have to the words above?

Legacy of tangible culture such as buildings, books, landscapes and intangible cultures such as folklore, language, traditions

## Question: What is ‘Invented Tradition’? How does this term subvert the traditional meaning of ‘tradition’?
