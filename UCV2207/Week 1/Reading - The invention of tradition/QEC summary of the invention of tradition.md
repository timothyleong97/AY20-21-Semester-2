# Title: The invention of tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland

| Question   | Is Highland culture a retrospective invention?               |
| ---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Evidence   | The bagpipe, to which the Scots ascribe great antiquity, is in fact largely modern. [need evidence] (pg 15) <br />The bagpipe was originally considered as a symbol of barbarism (page 15)<br />The Highlanders did not start out as a distinct people, but as an Irish colony with crude imitations of Irish culture (page 16) <br />The creation of an independent Highland tradition can be clearly seen in (page 16):<br />     - the usurpation of Irish culture and the re-writing of early Scottish history<br />     - the artificial creation of new Highland traditions, presented as ancient, original and distinctive<br />     - these traditions were intentionally spread across Scotland |
| Conclusion | The concept of a distinct Highland culture and tradition is a retrospective invention. The Scots have re-written their past to create a new, differentiated identity for themselves. Some of their traditions (differentiation of clan tartans, the wearing of kilts) and history (the poems of Ossian) which seem to have roots in an immemorial past are products of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. |
