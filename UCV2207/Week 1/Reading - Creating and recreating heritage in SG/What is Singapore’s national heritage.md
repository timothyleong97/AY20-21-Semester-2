# What is Singapore’s national heritage?

- Culturally, Singaporeans espouse Confucian Asian values
- Art, culture and lifestyles are influenced by Malay, Chinese and Indian cultures

What good has the government done?

- In the early 1990s, the STPB realised that some of
  the vanishing trades of Singapore were of interest to visitors. Since then, there
  have been numerous major preservation projects, including the designation of
  traditional tea merchants and herbalists in Chinatown as authentic trades

How have some perceived such preservation efforts?

- Such projects have their critics. It has been argued that tourism has led to
  Disneyfication.

- Chinatown, for example, has been pedestrianised, and Smith
  Street has become a ‘Food Alley’.

What role do museums play?

- Act as cultural memory banks
