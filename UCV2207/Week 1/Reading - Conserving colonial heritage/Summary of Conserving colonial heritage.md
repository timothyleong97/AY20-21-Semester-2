# Summary of Conserving colonial heritage

What is the paper about: 

Relationship between built heritage, conservation and tourism in colonial cities, using Raffles Hotel to show issues and conflicts between conservation and commercialisation of heritage



Where is the source of this tension?

Decisions have to be made about what forms of heritage to conserve and how to present them as tourist environments that will be attractive to visitors, and also generate revenue where appropriate, while remaining meaningful to residents.

Tourism could exploit cultures and their heritage - think beachfront hotels that belong to foreign corporations

> From the 1960’s onwards, tourism was seen as a great moderniser that could improve the prospects of developing countries. However, because these developing countries often did not have the means to develop this industry themselves, the resources and expertise of developed countries made it possible. This also meant the developed countries set the agenda for development, focusing on what would be a good model for a developed country in Europe, for instance. This, as stated by Hughes (in Lew, Hall and Williams, 2004:498-499) can be used as a way for developed countries to maintain control over developing nations and maintain the need for their dependency on developed countries.

> As Akama (in Hall and Tucker, 2004:140-141) points out, this is certainly the case in the development of safari tourism in Africa. It was initially created during the colonial era, and is still influenced by the power structures that existed at this time. This was certainly necessary in terms of the development of tourism as foreign investment was required. However, what is crucial here is that this neo-colonial influence means that whilst tourism meets the needs of those from developed countries, so the revenues generated often do not remain within the destination market, and so no development past this tourism is easily possible whilst there is such a reliance on the developed countries  - https://www.ukessays.com/essays/tourism/tourism-is-a-neo-colonialist-activity-tourism-essay.php

Did Singapore’s heritage gain or lose from tourist interests?

Raflles Hotel may not have been rebuilt had the tourism industry not taken an interest in it

Conclusion?
Colonial heritage has been claimed by government and the residents and is being employed by them to define and assert national identiy and for ttourism. The relationship is not one of subservience
