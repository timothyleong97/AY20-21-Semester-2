# Lecture 6

- National Museum of Cambodia

  - How does the site communicate to you?
  - Who’s doing the communicating - who is the “public” who is supposed to receive these messages
  - Objects that we use to create heritage and so how has these objects (the building itself included) changed/failed to change
    - Failed to change as in because of its status it kind of stayed the same on the outside only
  - In Cambodia, the line between sacred and royal is blurred
  - The  text in Khmer says thanks to the organisations for building the website but the english suggests says the organisation supports the whole museum
  - The Khmer version of the site is not built but the English one is
    - mainly for tourists
  - For exhibitions, there is some attempt to create some branding by having innovative exhibits

  What is the history of its building (who tried to influence it?)

  How much do you recognise and relate to in the museum? Like Abhayamudra 

  IS the museum offputting with how intellectually self conscious it is?

  Are the exhibits raising unconscious barriers?

The museum has an exclusive history

This museum was built in a time when freezing the past was enough

there isn’t 1 overarching message
