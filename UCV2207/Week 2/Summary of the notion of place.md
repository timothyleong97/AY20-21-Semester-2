# Summary of the notion of place

- Overview
  - The authors argue that the two imaginations can be simultaneously engaged by means of a focus on the concept of place
  - The authors next argue that a sense of nostalgia is a yearning to return to a lost period and place and why memory is often best served by anchoring it in the materiality of place.
  - While it lends itself to ideological uses by the powerful, a sense of place is also equally significant in the experiences and aspirations of a people.
  
- The salience (prominence) of place

  - It is the local milieu (social environment) which is “fundamental ... in structuring how people tackle ... the small and usually trivial problems of everyday life” (Johnston, 199 1 50); at the same time, it provides the context for collective acts of organisation and destruction, celebration and conflict (Cooke, 1989).
  - Alternatively, the phrase “Singapore’s place” could also suggest that Singapore occupies a
    particular moment in time, possibly a critical juncture or turning point in history which calls for
    contemplation of time that has passed (the past) as well as time to come (the future). In other words, Singapore today occupies a place between times, from which to survey the past and the future from the vantage point of the present.
  - Places are socially constructed positions and sites within the context of a particular
    period, that is, places have meaning only in relation to an individual’s or group’s goals and concerns
    (Entrikin, 19915).
  - People are active participants in the historically contingent process of the making of place: within
    the context of their times they construct places by investing them with human meaning.
  - This view recognises that all social life is “regionalised and
    regionalising” and that place-making is situated in specific time-space contexts (Rogers, 1992:245).
  - If place is both a specific concrete setting (as described in our first definition) as well as a
    constructed image (following our third definition), then it is in Daniels’ (1989:206) words both “a way of life” and “a way of seeing.”
  - On the one hand, “place” articulates social constructions imposed by those in power -planners,
    architects, administrators, politicians, property owners, developers - intent on advancing state
    policies and goals, consumer capitalism or some other prevalent ideologies. On the other hand,
    “place” is also a “multicoded space” which in its everyday usage, is constantly used and interpreted
    by “everyday people who may be ‘reading’ and ‘writing’ different languages in the built
    environment” (Goss, 1988:398).
  - For the everyday users of a particular place, it is an environment of
    opportunity and constraint. From this perspective,
    place is an active setting inextricably linked to the
    lives, movements and activities of individuals and,
    as such, a location of collective experiences which
    “evokes and organises memories, images, feelings,
    sentiments, meanings and the works of the
    imagination” (Walter, 1988:21).
  - Place has a dual character, as a repository of elite or state
    power and as a site of individual and collective
    struggle and resistance.
  - The social relations of everyday life are often objectified, and naturalised, in the specificities of place.
  - The powerful are often
    able to remake place in its own image, as seen in
    the creation of places of nationalism and pageantry
    such as civic centres and parade grounds (see
    Konrad, 1986); places of heroic consumption such
    as shopping malls and fairs (see Ley & Olds, 1988);
    and “heritagised” places such as historic
    conservation districts and museums (see Jacobs,
    1992)
  - At the same time, places are also sites of
    negotiation and resistance, not simply as concrete
    settings for action but also drawn upon in symbolic
    ways to express individual and collective sentiments.

  + An organised group may seize upon a specific public
    place not simply as an arena to stage a protest,
    demonstration or some form of public collective
    behaviour but also to appropriate, manipulate or
    sometimes invert the symbolic values associated
    with the place.
  + Individuals and communities may
    also invest specific places with memories and
    meanings which may be, if not contradictory,
    different, from the views and intentions of the
    powerful. In effect, “place” is neither fully defined
    by those who hold power nor completely
    appropriated by ordinary people; instead, “place as
    process” implies a politics of place where social
    relations dependent on particular combinations of
    social, cultural, economic and political factors are
    mediated in different ways.
  + For Agnew and Duncan
    (1 989:7), the “power of place” resides in the fact
    that place:
    serves as a constantly re-energized repository
    of socially and politically relevant traditions
    and identity which serve to mediate between
    the everyday lives of individuals on the one
    hand, and the national and supra-national
    institutions which constrain and enable those
    lives. on the other.

- Place and time

  - As Singapore has developed an
    open, capitalist economy which is increasingly
    locked into regional and global dynamics, society
    has also become exposed to western ideas and
    norms. The governing elites were increasingly
    apprehensive of the dangers of Singaporeans
    losing their “Asian” roots and the consequences
    for society.
  - According to a state-appointed
    Committee on Heritage set up in April 1988, an
    understanding of one’s roots and the lessons of
    history can help younger Singaporeans “balance our
    Asian values and western influences”, appreciate
    and “draw inspiration” from the city’s multicultural
    diversity and “constantly renew work values and
    maintain the adaptiveness which underlies our
    economic success’’ (The Committee on Heritage
    Report, 1988:6-8).

- History: The interlocking nature of place and time
  - The making of a place is closely intertwined
    with individual and collective biographies; at the
    same time, the unfolding of personal and social
    histories is not only about the passage of time, but
    also about being “in”, moving “through” and
    experiencing changing places. **In fact, the invisible**
    **movement of time is sometimes indexed by changes**
    **which have taken place in the visible landscape:**
    the demolition of the last kumpung (rural village)
    on the main island of Singapore signals the passing
    of an era while the construction of skyscrapers of
    steel and glass heralds the arrival of the
    technological age.
  - As the palimpsests on which people write their
    stories, not only are places repositories of history
    and memory, they often contain multiple levels of
    sedimented history.
  - Places also become identified with national histories
    because they feature in an integral manner in events
    and episodes of collective proportions
  - Places thus have a
    “depth” which goes beyond the visible landscape:
    they contain layers of meaning derived from
    different biographies and histories. Place meanings
    are further strengthened when levels of personal
    biography and collective history are compounded.
  - If places are the amalgam of forms and meanings
    laid down in various historical eras, interpreting
    places involves understanding the human legacies
    of the past
  - However, as Driver (1988:499) has
    observed, “the past does not bequeath an immutable
    legacy, if only because history is continually
    rewritten by its inheritors.” As such, the association
    of a place with its own history is not a
    straightforward one. As history is constructed and
    reconstructed, as each generation emphasises
    particular historical “truths” and subject others to
    the workings of amnesia, places also change in
    meaning.
  - Conversely, history may also be rewritten
    through the rewriting of places. The renaming of
    streets in postcolonial societies, for example, divests
    the landscape of colonial associations and reinforces
    the legitimacy of the newly independent state
    (Lewandowski, 1984; Yeoh, 1992).
  - Place histories may also be obscured if not obliterated by
    rapid, radical changes of the natural or built
    environment. The metamorphosis which Tiong
    Bahru (formerly cemetery ground) underwent in the
    construction of a Singapore Improvement Trust
    housing estate between the 1930s and 1950s and
    the more recent transformation of Bishan into a
    middle-class Housing and Development Board
    (HDB) public housing estate erase from people’s
    memories their older histories as places with
    extensive Chinese burial grounds.

- Nostalgia: yearning for the loss of a period and place

  - Nostalgia is an attitude towards the past
    wherein elements of the past are viewed favourably,
    celebrated and even glorified.
  - According to Chase and Shaw (1989), there are
    at least three conditions for nostalgia. First, societies
    with a secular and linear (as opposed to cyclical)
    sense of time are more prone to the syndrome of
    nostalgia. Second, the stance of nostalgia requires
    some apprehension of the deficiency of the present.
    Third, nostalgia is likely when social change is rapid
    enough to be detectable in one lifetime; at the same
    time, there are must be available evidences of the
    past - artefacts, images and texts - to remind
    one of how things used to be. We would like to
    show that particular constructions of place and time
    are both strongly implicated in the stance of
    nostalgia.
  - In the local
    context, Chua (1995) argues that the disappearance
    of the kampung from the Singapore landscape
    symbolises the conflation of a lost time and a lost
    place, which in turn translates into a loss of
    community and the innocence of childhood on
    both individual and collective levels.
  - Shaw, 1989:8), is
    held up as a critical foil to the present. Nostalgia is
    hence a critique of the present time and place.
    Chua’s (1995) work shows that the popularisation
    of nostalgia for kampungs in the 1990s reflects an
    unease with the frenetic pace of life, high stress
    levels and new-found materialism characteristic of
    modem living driven by the logic of capital.
  - Nostalgia is hence a construction of the past but
    a condition of the present. As it is positioned in the
    present but draws on resources of the past, nostalgia
    is paradoxically best nurtured not in circumstances
    when the past has been completely obliterated but
    when remnants of the past remain to constantly
    remind one that the past was different, a “foreign
    country” where “they do things differently” (Hartley,
    quoted in Lowenthal, 1985:xvi).

  - Pervasive nostalgia
    thus requires the presence of artefacts, images, texts
    and other visual and oral records of the past. Indeed,
    a nostalgic harking back to common roots is well
    served by continuous exposure to landscape texts
    and visual images of the past
  - The danger is that
    the past as finds itself gradually
    bracketed, and then effaced altogether, leaving us
    with nothing but (Chase
    Shaw, 1989:lO).
  - While a place comprises both the material
    built environment as well as the activities and lifestyle
    of inhabitants, state conservation efforts have paid
    greater attention to the former (Kong & Yeoh,
    1994:260)
  - As a landscape
    text to generate awareness of the nation’s past, place
    is invoked as a concrete showcase of history rather
    than as an active process. Emphasis is given to the
    visual qualities, the facades and concrete forms which
    constitute place rather than the **lifeworlds** integral to
    the making of place.
  - **Part of the reason for this**
    **could be that while lifeworlds are much less**
    **susceptible to state control and can only be retained**
    **with warts and all, built forms are easily amenable**
    **to sprucing up to reflect an idealised picture of the**
    **past. The re-creation of the past in a place gives the**
    **state the opportunity to filter out what it deems**
    **undesirable and to retain what it considers beneficial**
    **to cultivating a sense of cohesion and national**
    **identity. History is thus recycled as nostalgia.**
  - Selective visual reminders of
    the past embedded in the landscape which people
    encounter in everyday life - historic districts and
    conservation areas, monuments and memorials, icons
    and signage - are intended not only to evoke a
    positive evaluation of the past but also to inspire a
    collective sense of where we have come from
  - While nostalgia describes a general and
    somewhat nebulous sentiment of looking back into
    and yearning for the past, heritage refers to the
    making of “an apparently immutable history present
    in the now of society - as a logic of the concrete”
    (Crang, 1994:341). This fixing of history into
    heritage is by no means an uncontested process
    because what constitutes heritage is differently
    interpreted in different quarters with different
    sectoral and communal interests.
  - The question
    of what constitutes heritage that is worth conserving
    is thus highly problematic as it depends on what is
    thought to be historically significant.
  - For the sake of polarising the issue, Hardy
    (1988:333) draws a distinction between heritage
    used in a conservative and heritage as a
    radical In the former sense, the definition
    of heritage is strictly circumscribed to include ideas
    and artefacts of high culture By this
    measure, elements of the urban landscape which
    qualify as heritage include the majestic and
    monumental, such as palaces, stately homes, national
    symbols and civic buildings. More recently, the
    perspective on heritage has been widened by those
    who advocate more cogent, credible, realist
    alternative views [of the past], centred on the lived
    experiences of a wider spectrum of the populace
  - Such a “radical” concept of heritage focuses, inter alia, on reclaiming the lived
    landscapes of common people such as the homes of
    the labouring classes, neighbourhood streets and
    alleys, factories and workplaces, and community
    structures. According to Lowenthal
    985:388), in the west, conservation efforts formerly reserved for
    features of renown and widely venerated
    are now more generally extended to
    the everyday neighbourhoods of purely local
    More specifically, Tunbridge (1989:3 16)
    argues that in Canada, the awareness of vernacular
    heritage, that of the common was already
    firmly established by the 1970s.

  - In Singapore, from the state’s perspective, heritage has important social, economic and political
    purposes. Not only does it represent the city’s
    cultural wealth and diversity, it serves to bind
    Singaporeans in a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural state
    together and also to “sell” Singappore abroad as an
    exotic tourist destination (Kong & Yeoh, 1994:253-
    55). For heritage to serve these purposes, it must
    be carefully defined and packaged. In codifying
    heritage, the state’s strongest strategy is to objectify
    heritage either in “specialist” places (such as
    museums) or broader showcase-type landscapes
    (such as historic streets and districts or sites where
    signage and other markers help signify historicity).
  - Given the contentious nature of heritage and the
    multiple meanings it holds in different quarters,
    inscribing heritage into the concrete elements which
    constitute place furnishes the state a strategy of
    codifying and naturalking its version of heritage.
    By becoming part of the everyday, visible world,
    the landscape text of a place acts as a powerful
    ideological tool which:
    ... masks the artifice and ideological nature
    of its form and content. lts history as a
    social construction is unexamined. It is,
    therefore, as unwittingly read as it is
    unwittingly written (Duncan, 1989: 19).
  - By objectifying heritage in concrete, visual form,
    values and ideologies are reified and fixed, and made
    much less transparent
  - The production of Tanjong
    Pagar as the repository of spectacle obscures more
    problematic tensions and contradictions such as the
    reduction of history to architecture;
  - It is when socially constructed
    categories become embodied as part of the
    landscape, that they become more readily accepted
    as natural and unquestionable.
  - Yet, while it is often the powerful whose ideas
    and categories are inscribed in the landscape, further
    contributing to their power (Schorske, 1980), the
    less powerful do attempt to redefine the constitution
    of heritage using particular sites of resistance and
    negotiation
  - Yet,
    it is clear that most of these efforts to define the
    meaning of heritage fail precisely because
    “ordinary” people do not have the power to “define”
    places in the same way that the state does. Defining
    our past thus involves defining the nature of place
    in the present; and because the powerful have control
    over the making of place, the definition of the past
    has hitherto remained in their hands.
  - The effect
    is that few stay in a place long enough to develop a
    deepening of human relationships in a field of care
    and few will have the critical historical 
    (Rowles, 1983:303; see also Kong, Yeoh
    &
    Teo,
    1993) in relationships with their places. Will there
    be a generation of displaced people, a people
    without (Wolf, 1982), in the years ahead?

PLACE IS FOUR_DIMENSIONAL-  defined by time also, and by the people that live there
