# Lecture 4

- Want to talk about history dispassionately

- But the human condition is what we want to get insights on but still we need to do so at a distance

- A Native American may refrain from excavating Native American bones because of cultural reasons
- Not just about the value of the question - who has the right to know about some kind of culture or history?

- Loss of meaning leads to anxiety - leads to xenophobia, fear of change in general

- Globalisation led to homogeneity of experiences like shopping, dining - McDonald-isation of everyday experiences
  - Same experience everywhere
  - McDonalds provides a cultural safe harbour for people who feel like there is nothing in common with their own culture - it’s a common denominator
  - So it’s hard to say in black or white terms whether some cultural change is good or bad - it depends on personal experiences - how do tourists and locals and different groups of people see the meaning of something
- In Peru, a lot of Spanish architecture built on Incan foundations (literal blocks) - the Spanish demolished buildings and created their own
  - Spanish didn’t care about the churches, they wanted to play up cultural symbolism of these already holy sites by building their own establishments there
  - The Spanish and Incans see buildings vs. space

- In developmental states, if the government is so successful at development, there will be no distinction between the government and the ruling party
  - If the ruling party was voted out, it would be unclear what happens to the state of development

- What are people, planning boards, architects, government officials, saying or feeling at that time that influences how they thought about something?
  - social attitudes, social climate
  - economic needs and social needs
- You can refurbish a building, but not the place-ness or experience of it
  - just preserving the building is not preserving culture
  - shophouses - people who worked there, lived there and had great community presence
    - contributing to commercial development of the locality
      

- Entropy made visible - James Kuntsler
  - Suburban sprawl 

  - A sense of place  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
    - Your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings
    - The public realm in America has two roles: dwelling place of civic life, the physical manifestation of the common good
    - If the public realm is degraded, civic life takes a hit
    - The public realm of America is the street
    - Civic design is the culture and knowledge of building 
      - Public realm has to inform us where we are in our culture
      - Grounding us culturally and emotionally
      - Good public space is an outdoor public room
      - Needs an active and permeable membrane around the edge like bars, shops and consequently the centre that the membrane encloses is where people want to be in

- Boston city hall plaza is drab, so no culture - no message
- It makes people not want to be there - its not civically rich enough for people to go there
- Shops on second floor destroy the relationship between the retail and the sidewalk

- Street trees do spatial denotation of the pedestrian realm, soften hardscape of the buildings
- Distinction between the country and the rural 
- The original counter-idea to the brutalist city was just to inject as much of country living into blocked architecture - grass and trees around buildings
- Bad architecture induces anxiety 

- a new urbanism - a body of methodology and principle and skill to compose meaningful places integral to civic life
- Transport networks caused us to lose the sense of community
- Does the building invite you in? Does it treat you like one more termite?
