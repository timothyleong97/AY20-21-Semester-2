# Summary of Searching for place identity

## Place of urban conservation in Singapore

- The identification with symbols and landmarks in the built environment and the general culture of
  place are said to enhance the collective memory of place identities and localities.
- Almost in a similar vein, the former Singapore Senior Minister, Mr S. Rajaratnam announced,
  …a nation must have a memory to give it a sense of cohesion, continuity and identity. The
  longer the past, the greater the awareness of a nation’s identity…a sense of a common history is
  what provides the links to hold together a people who came from the four corners of the earth.
  (Urban Redevelopment Authority (n.d.)

- These days, more than 200,000 Singaporeans work overseas. And many more travel frequently,
  laying their heads down to sleep in distant lands, gazing at novel views from their
  windows… its
  people have come to assimilate more global influences. Today’s populace likes having a
  Starbucks around the corner and glittering megamalls. They want the cinema multiplexes, and
  offices of glass and chrome. But these are the hallmarks of a generic upscale town. If these are
  the only features of our landscape, we would be possessing only the typical structures of a high
  end MacCity. What makes this city uniquely Singapore, distinct and separate from so many
  others, are the buildings of our heritage. (Bachtiar, 2002)
- Decades of ‘urban renewal’ and 
  ‘redevelopment’ of a savage kind have taught many communities that when the urban
  landscape is battered, important collective memories are obliterated. (Hayden 1995)
- Conservation as practiced in Singapore includes a strong component of change and adaptation
  towards what is perceived as an improved environment rather than the simple preservation of
  entire old lifeless areas with their ‘riot of history, architectural style and character’ (Liu, 1990).

## Forging a sense of place

- According to Relph (1976) and Norberg-Schulz (1980, p. 23), every place has what they define as
  genius loci or the spirit of place, representing not just ‘a mere flow of phenomena, but has a
  structure and incorporates meanings’. This is supported by a growing number of authors from
  different disciplines including Lynch (1972), Proshanky, Fabian and Kaminoff (1983) and
  Lowenthal (1985) who have stressed the importance of place identity for human well-being.
  Korpela (1989) enlarges this perspective by arguing on the basis of empirical findings that place
  identity is part of the individual’s on-going processes of emotion- and self-regulation that may
  most involve one’s sense of self. In other words, place identity can help to provide a sense of stability and continuity, it helps to construct and preserve our identity. As Lang (1994) observed,
  old buildings give us a sense of history and permanence. We would like to know not only where
  we are but also when we are and how ‘now’ relates to time past and to come. Space and time
  together are two of the major dimensions within which we live.

- Several human geographers have elaborated on the
  negative consequences of a lack of place attachment or rootlessness and placelessness (Relph,
  1976; Tuan, 1980). Having a sense of being in a particular environment, being fascinated by what
  is found there and finding it to be of some pleasure are all behaviours presumably susceptible to
  processes that also work in the development of place attachment.
- In other words, to fully understand and evaluate places, we must know,
  - What behaviour is associated with it or may be anticipated will occur in a given location;
  - What the physical properties of that setting are; and 
  - The evaluative conceptions, which people hold of behaviour in that environment (Canter, 1977,
    p.159).

- The conceptions that people have of the places in which they find themselves as Canter (1977)
  states, are frequently the scientific key, which will unlock the processes by which those places have
  their impact. They are the representations that have an influence on the conservation identity,
  thus important considerations in decisions regarding what is to be conserved. It follows from this
  that conservation potential cannot be analysed without examination of the essential aspects of
  places: people, settings and meanings
- Inadequacies in the setting are far more tolerable and more easily adjusted when one is not
  alienated from the place making process.

## The search for identity

- The challenge is to create a thriving world-class city in the 21st century where
  Singapore is not just a workplace but also a home
- The view is taken further
  with serious attention on quality of life and heritage conservation and articulated as a major
  planning dilemma of how Singapore should seek to preserve a sense of identity while optimising
  the use of land.
- The most interesting outcome of the consultation exercise was the process and volume of
  responses. As one focus group participant observed,
  The process of public participation is unparalleled… The URA has taken a back seat to let the
  public discuss. It did not impose (its views) or insist on things, but listened and made all the
  logistics possible for us to interview and discuss with various authorities, so this Concept Plan
  comes with a very good cross-section view. (The Sunday Times, 29 April 2001)
- State-driven
  conservation while with merits may overlook the delights of familiar places for the richness of
  places and people’s attachment to them grows from their everyday use of these spaces. As Wagner
  and Mikesell (1971, pp. 6–7) have argued, these places are developed through a process of
  ‘internal evolution’ from a range of elements and activities to form a ‘culture complex’ that is ‘so
  elaborate and idiosyncratic that it would be very unlikely to recur accidentally in widely separate
  places’
- Such areas occupy special niche in the hearts of people and have the intangible effect of
  increasing resident attachment to place.
- In
  resonance with the wider global processes, place identity and urban heritage are increasingly
  recognised as key building blocks for economic well being and social vitality.

- As summarised by the focus group on identity versus intensive use of land,
  current conservation efforts in a number of cases (for example, Chinatown) have been more
  successful in conserving the physical fabric and less in the cultural elements

- People doing “unofficial” things like graffiti, f&b

- The people in charge are creating heritage - but sometimes it’s more for the tourists
