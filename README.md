# AY20-21-Semester-2
Central repository of my notes and homework for this semester

Scrum is a framework for agile development. 
There are four steps – the sprint planning, daily standup, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.
Additionally there are three artifacts to be maintained throughout the development life cycle – the product backlog, sprint backlog and the increment/demo
-	The product backlog is the master list of work that needs to be done. This includes features, requirements, enhancements and fixes. This backlog is the input for the sprint backlog. Constant re-prioritization of the items is essential.
-	The sprint backlog is the list of items, user stories, fixes that have to be done for this sprint. While it can evolve slightly, the fundamental goal of a sprint must not change.
-	Increment/demo refers to a usable end-product from the end of a sprint. In the case of academics, it could be a summary of lecture and tutorial notes, or a cheat sheet segment. 
The sprint has 6 steps:
1.	Backlog refinement (both product backlog and sprint backlog) 
	-	Things to add/remove
	- Re-prioritise requirements
	- Update requirements
2.	Sprint planning 
	- Pull tickets from product backlog to sprint backlog
	- Set priorities for each ticket
3.	Sprint
	 -  Complete each ticket before a deadline
	 - Ensure WIP limit is not breached
4.	Daily standup
	-	What did you accomplish yesterday
	-	What are you working on today
	-	What blocking points are you facing
5.	Sprint Review
	-	What have you accomplished this sprint
	-	Get feedback on progress or any issues 
	-	Rework the product backlog based on the current sprint
6.	Sprint Retrospective
	-	What went well
	-	What went wrong
	-	What must change

A sprint has 3 roles:
1.	Product owner
	-	Understands product requirements and translates them into user stories
    - 	Sets priorities for each user story/ticket
	-	Update product backlog
2.	Scrum master
	-	Carry out ceremonies
	-	Remove impediments
	-	Document retrospective and review feedback for each subsequent round
3.	Developer
	- Focuses on closing 1 ticket at a time, as fast as possible

Scrum differs from Kanban in the order of deciding tickets for an iteration – in scrum, you set the iteration’s duration, then estimate workload, but in Kanban, you decide on your WIP limit, then calculate iteration time from there.

Before the start of the first sprint, a delivery roadmap must be drawn up. Roadmaps are all your epics on a timeline, and each epic has several requirements and user stories.

Instead of code reviews I do document reviews where I vet the quality of tutorial answers, lecture notes etc.

To properly review my own work I need to draft up some acceptance criteria for each type of document
-	Lecture notes
	-	Should have examples where the lecture slides do not provide them
	-	Should be easily memorisable 
	-	Should be at most 2 A4 pages
-	Cheat sheet segment
    -	Should contain things that are quotable/pluggable into a question
	-	Should not have theoretical explanations
Kanban uses cycle/ead time which measures the time it takes from commitment to fulfilment of a ticket.

You determine how many workflow states you want – to do, in progress, document review and done, etc. You have to set a Work-In-Progress limit for every column except Done. 

Kanban has no fixed iteration time unlike scrum.

In a Kanban board, you have visual signals, or tickets, and your columns compose a workflow. For each ticket, you log the commitment point and the delivery point. The time difference between the two is the lead time.

In a ticket, you have a brief description of the task, its owner, due date and status, and any blocking points or references to documentation. For transitions between workflow states, have some execution policy.
