# File and folder naming conventions

## Technical courses

1. All materials for a course should be in a root level folder with just the name of the course, e.g. CS3223.
2. Have a mega problem set folder, e.g. Problem_Set_CS3223
   1. Sample questions from the lecture 
   2. Technical explanations, things to memorise - make questions out of all of them
   3. Add tutorial questions in
   4. Textbook questions as well
   5. Past year papers
   6. __Always tag the lecture__
3. Build a cheat sheet out of the lecture notes (both long form and short form)
   1. Long form = lecture notes in point form
   2. Short form = 1 A4 sized page of shorthand notes

4. **Two weeks** before a test:
   1. Make quizzes from your mega problem set for each lecture, e.g. Quiz_1_CS3223

## Non-technical courses

1. All materials for a course should be in a root level folder with just the name of the course.
2. Build one study guide
   1. Each lecture should be broken down into *Question-Evidence-Conclusion* form notes.
   2. Each discussion should be broken down into a bullet list of important observations.
   3. Readings for a lecture should also be digested in a *Question-Evidence-Conclusion* format and kept in the study guide.
   4. Notes for a lecture or reading assignment should be in the same subfolder if they are for the same topic. Your folder will have 1 sub-folder for each self-contained topic in the end, filled with QEC digests of each reading or lecture, and with bullet lists from all discussions on that topic.
